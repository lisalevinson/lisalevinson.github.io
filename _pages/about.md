One way to describe the focus of my research is as 'morphosemantics'. I want to better understand what the atomic units of compositional semantics are, and the extent to which those atomic units can be mapped to atomic morphosyntactic constituents. In my recent work, I've been pursuing the hypothesis that morphology is akin to syntax, in the tradition of Distributed Morphology, and exploring the predictions this makes for compositional semantics at the morphological level. To this end, I am working to integrate the study of lexical and 'subatomic' meaning into the fold of formal semantics. I'm also pursuing psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic approaches to investigating related questions of lexical representation.

I teach courses in semantics, psycholinguistics, and general linguistics. I also coordinate undergraduate research initiatives for the linguistics department and help to connect undergraduates with research opportunities in the department.
