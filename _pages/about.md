I recently moved to the linguistics department at U of M, and was previously a tenured associate professor at Oakland University until 2019. I'm very excited to now be a part of the amazing community at Michigan where I am both a Lecturer III and the Director of Undergraduate Research Experiences.

My research interests could be broadly described as semantics and psycholinguistics, but basically I am obsessed with VERBS. One way to describe the focus of my research is as 'morphosemantics'. I want to better understand what the atomic units of compositional semantics are, and the extent to which those atomic units can be mapped to atomic morphosyntactic constituents. Since I work on primarily on verbs, my semantic focus tends to be on issues of event structure and argument structure. I also am very interested in the ways that experimental work can inform linguistic theory and our understanding of linguistic representations, in addition to understanding verb processing from a 'purely' psycholinguistic perspective.

I currently am setting up the UM WordLab, working with students (especially undergraduates) on experimental and computational research focusing on lexical (VERB!) representations (also other syntactic categories are welcome, if that's you thing). If you're a student interested in joining my lab, please send me an email.

I teach courses in psycholinguistics, semantics, and general linguistics. As the Director for Undergraduate Research Experiences, I also help to connect undergraduates with research opportunities in the department.
