title: "The Roots of Verbs"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2007-roots-verbs-diss
excerpt: 'Theories of lexical semantics and syntactic decomposition usually make a distinction between
the role of the ‘idiosyncratic’ lexical component of words, the ‘constant’ or ‘root’,
and that of the functional elements which are shared between different members of a word
class. Understanding the properties of such lexical building blocks is central to our understanding
of language. However, most work thus far has focused on the functional building
blocks. In particular, there has been little work addressing the formal semantics of lexical
roots. In this dissertation, I focus on a particular class of verbs, implicit creation verbs,
and argue that these are derived from roots which denote predicates of individuals. These
verbs are contrasted with verbs derived from roots of different types, toward the goal of
developing a complete ontology of roots. I argue that many of the generalizations derived
in other work from syntactic categories can in fact be derived from semantic root type.
The analysis presented for the compositional construction of verbs has consequences for
the nature of lexical decomposition, the analysis of resultative secondary predicates, the
analysis of verb particles, and the relationship between syntactic and semantic categories.'
